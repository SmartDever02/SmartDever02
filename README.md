**I am open to any collaboration on exciting projects!**

<!-- START -->

I am a full stack software engineer who plays with javascript all the day.

I specialize in web development and I personally like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

As a full time employee, I am not able to contribute to Next.js but instead I am a community helper in the [official Next.js Discord server](https://nextjs.org/discord).

You can find me in the [forum leaderboard](https://nextjs-forum.com) - James4u.

Apart from Next.js, I am also interested in [Stencil.js](https://stenciljs.com) as web components can be embeded easily in any of our projects!

When I work I drink a lot of â˜• and also in my free time, I like to watch animes or play [Dota2](https://www.dota2.com/), [Project-007](https://ioi.dk/project-007).
